```

## Further Development

...

- Redis - caching most recent, rate limiting
- IaC - terraform for deployment on AWS or K8s
- CI/CD - pipeline for redeploying on updates, minified dockerfile with prebuilt binary (and without Docker-in-Docker) saved as artifact and deployed
- Postman Integration Tests

- Unit Test
  - Swagger
  - OpenAPI generator
- additional logging and error messages for bad queries (e.g. validation errors)
- security hardening (remove .env thats there for demonstration purposes)
